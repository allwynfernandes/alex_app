Hi Alf, I created the video, and I walked through every step of the payment application process.

 

Please remember:

 

    Sum of “Invoice Application” must be equal to “Payment Amount”
    Discount must be equal to the difference of (“Payment Amount” PLUS credit amount) and sum of all open invoices being paid.
    Sum of “Invoice Application”, Discount, and Credit must be equal to the sum of all open invoices in NetSuite
