Hi Alf, please review the attached files.

 

The csv file is from NetSuite, and the xlsx file are multiple payments received from the customer.

On Sheet6, there is a payment containing a credit. Everything else does not have a credit.

 

Please test your system on all the sheets except Sheet6, and produce CSV files so I can test them on my end.
